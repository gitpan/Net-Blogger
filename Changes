0.6


   Moved most of the code in to Blogger::API::Core,

   Blogger::Engine::Blogger

   Replaced use of Frontier::Client with XMLRPC::Lite
   (in Blogger::Engine::Base)

   Updated POD

0.5.1


   Modified internals to load implementation specific
   subclass based on the engine argument passed to
   the constructor. Props to Simon Kittles for the
   smack upside the head about the right way to do
   this :-)

   Updated POD.

0.5


   Added Blogger API getPost method.

   Updated POD.

0.4.6.1


   Added Blogger.pm BLOGGER_PROXY constant.

   Added Blogger.pm Proxy and MaxPostPostLength
   accessors for corresponding constants. Previously,

   [insert blogger-mimicking interface here]
   subclasses to override the methods and specify an
   approriate value.

    Wrapped Frontier::Client method calls in eval
    statements to prevent unnecessary die-ing.

    private _TrimPostBody method.

    (boolean, array)

    Updated POD.

    Made sure all Blogger.pm methods begin with title
    case.

0.4.2



    Added private Blogger.pm _Encode method. Code courtesy of
    Matt Sergeant's rssmirror.pl script. Someone, give this
    guy a YAS grant.

    would end up subscripting outside of the string.
